## Polymorphism
Polymorphism the concept of using different classes in place of one another.
Specifically, an object is polymorphic if it can be used in place of one or more classes or interfaces.
The intended use of a polymorphic object is to allow objects that are children of a parent class to be used as their parent class or for multiple objects that inherit from an interface to be used as the interface.
